# PortScanner

A custom host scanning tool that probes for open ports and checks for services running on those ports, similar to nmap. Currently, only TCP ports are functional but UDP is planned to be added at a later time.

# Compile

  $ make
  
# Execute

  $ ./portScan --help 
                (to view all flags, options, and argument syntax)
